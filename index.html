                            this fucking page. This whole paragraph was just lorem ipsum for weeks until one of the
                            investors noticed. We've already been through three CEO's and changed our business model
                            twice, so the notion that there is anyone here who can actually summarize our company's
                            fucking offering is pretty ludicrous. Still - the agency said we needed to have an about
                            page, so here you fucking go - half a paragraph we copied out of someone else's business
                            plan:</p>
                        <p>The company's marketing strategy rests on the belief that its products and services represent
                            a value-added approach to interpreting, qualifying, and understanding the complexities of
                            the computer industry and technology markets. To implement this strategy, the company
                            intends to place paid advertising banners on strategic websites in the computer fields and
                            to utilize search engine portal and general media advertising.</p>
                        <p>Whaddya think? Pretty fucking believable, right? Also - check out those blurry-ass business
                            people back there. They are clearly also doing business. So you know we mean fucking
                            business.</p>

                        senior VP's thought 3 sections looked a little light in the comps. So we threw in a slate where
                        we would "flush out the offering". They ate that shit up at the meeting, but it turns out what
                        that actually means is "adding another bullshit 2 or 3 sentence paragraph that get passed around
                        until it has become totally devoid of meaning and leaving it to die in a shit-ton of whitespace
                        so it looks 'strong'."
